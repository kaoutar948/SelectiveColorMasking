## Learning Source

This project was inspired by and built upon the knowledge gained from YouTube Tutorial: Detecting color with Python and OpenCV using HSV colorspace(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFNDh5k3SjU&ab_channel=Computervisionengineer), created by Felipe. The tutorial provided valuable insights and guidance on openCV and HSV color space.

It's important to acknowledge the tutorial source as it played a significant role in the development of this project.
